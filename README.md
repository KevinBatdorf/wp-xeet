## Features
- Embed a Tweet/Xeet without an iframe
- Save 500kb of page load
- No Twitter/X cookies, tracking, JavaScript, etc
- Static - Twitter/X changes won't affect your site
- Dark/light auto mode
- Built off of Vercel's React Tweet library ([announcement](https://vercel.com/blog/introducing-react-tweet))

Note: "Xeet" is not an official replacement word for a "Tweet", but it's a fun word nonetheless. I may remove "Xeet" from the UI in the future, but will keep this plugin name.

### WordPress.org plugin repo

The queue for new plugins is months now, so I won't be able to submit this fpr review for some time. However, you can safely use it now by downloading it from this URL (click the first job, then find the artifact at the bottom), and when it's approved it will update automatically.
