ðŸ§š Hey! Listen!
> "Xeet" is not an official replacement word for a "Tweet", but it's a fun word nonetheless. X.com isn't use this in their apps language, so it's unaffiliated (where as previously "Tweet" was an issue).

### WordPress.org plugin repo

The queue for new plugins is months now, so I won't be able to submit this for review for some time. However, you can safely use it now by downloading it from this URL (click the first job, then find the artifact at the bottom), and when it's approved it will update automatically.
